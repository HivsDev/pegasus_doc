--- # Foreword **Overview** This document is written for engineers using the DPU for binocular
stereo-vision development. It walks through the tooling required to
generate the inputs the DPU needs. **Product version** | Product | Version |
|---|---|
| Hi3403V100 | V100 |
| | V100 | **Audience** Primarily aimed at: - Technical-support engineers
- Software-development engineers **Change history** | Doc version | Release date | Description |

| 04 | 2025-08-29 | Aligned with the v1.1 beta3 release. |
| 03 | 2024-12-30 | Updated to match the v1.1 beta2 release. |
| 02 | 2024-09-30 | Tracked the changes shipped with v1.1 beta1. |
| 01 | 2024-06-30 | First release. | **Symbol conventions** | Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **DANGER** | Hazard with a high level of risk; if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury. |
| **WARNING** | Hazard with a medium level of risk; if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury. |
| **CAUTION** | Hazard with a low level of risk; if not avoided, could result in minor or moderate injury. |
| **NOTICE** | Potentially hazardous situation; if not avoided, could damage equipment, lose data, degrade performance, or yield unanticipated results. |
| **NOTE** | Important information, best practices, and tips not related to personal injury. | ## What is DPU? **DPU** (Depth Processing Unit) is the binocular stereo-vision
hardware accelerator on Hi3403V100. It computes per-pixel disparity
from two synchronised cameras (a "stereo rig") in real time, which can
then be turned into a depth / distance map. ## Tools provided The DPU 2.0 tool suite covers the offline preparation steps: - **Camera calibration** — intrinsic + extrinsic parameters of each camera.
- **Stereo rectification** — derive the rectification map from calibration data.
- **Disparity-tuning** — interactively adjust DPU parameters with live preview.
- **LUT generation** — compress the rectification + tuning data into the look-up tables the DPU consumes at runtime. The end-to-end workflow takes you from a pair of raw stereo videos
through to a `.bin` file the on-board DPU loads. ## Workflow at a glance `mermaid

patterns, parameter ranges, troubleshooting — lives in the rest of the
upstream guide. The Chinese page renders today via the i18n fallback
(switch the language toggle to read it directly); a fully translated
English version is on the docs roadmap. For the runtime side (how to load the LUT and call the DPU AP Is from
your application code), see the ![Motion Fusion](figures/)
chapter and the
![Open Harmony / Linux peripheral interface](figures/).
